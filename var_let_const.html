/* Since we are using "let a=10", scope of "a" is limited to block 1 and "a" is not recognized in block 2 */
var: The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “var” is limited to the “function” within which it is defined. If it is defined outside any function, the scope of the variable is global.
var is “function scoped”.

{
    var a=10;
    console.log(a);
  } //block 1
  {
    a++;
    console.log(a);
  } //block 2
  /* Since we are using "var a=10", scope of "a" is limited to the function within which it is defined. In this case it is within the global function scope */
let: The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “let” or “const” is limited to the “block” defined by curly braces i.e. {} .
“let” and “const” are“block scoped”.

{
    let a=10;
    console.log(a);
   } //block 1
   {
     a++;
     console.log(a);
   } //block 2

const: The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “const” is limited to the block defined by curly braces. However if a variable is defined with keyword const, it cannot be reassigned.
“const” cannot be re-assigned to a new value. However it CAN be mutated.

/*Why would you chose “let” over “var”?
While programming in Javascript it is a good practice not to define variables as global variables. This is because it is possible to inadvertently modify the global variable from anywhere within the Javascript code. To prevent this one needs to ensure that the scope of the variables are limited to the code block within which they need to be executed.
